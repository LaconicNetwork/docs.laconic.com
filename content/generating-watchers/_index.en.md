In the Laconic stack, watchers are similar to using "The Graph", but come with numerous benefits such as:

- fast syncing data
- open source framework
- verifiable computations
- easier than writing a subgraph
- plugin to the stack orchestrator framework

Next, we document how to use the Laconic watcher framework to generate verifiable GraphQL queries for your smart contracts.

### Example - Azimuth

The Urbit project uses smart contracts on Ethereum for their Azimuth PKI. Laconic created a watcher for it.

- see the [Azimuth Watcher overview](https://github.com/LaconicNetwork/awesome-urbit/blob/main/docs/azimuth-watcher.md) for more information
- the [Azimuth stack](./azimuth-stack.md) is a minimal example of creating a stack to deploy a newly generated watcher
