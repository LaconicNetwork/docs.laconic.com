In the Laconic stack, watchers are similar to using "The Graph", but come with numerous benefits such as:

- fast syncing data
- open source framework
- verifiable computations
- easier than writing a subgraph
- plugin to the stack orchestrator framework

Next, we document how to use the Laconic watcher framework to generate verifiable GraphQL queries for your smart contracts.

### Example - Azimuth

The Urbit project uses smart contracts on Ethereum for their Azimuth PKI. The [Laconic Azimuth watcher](https://github.com/cerc-io/azimuth-watcher-ts) is a good example to start with. It is firstly autogenerated using `codegen` then modified by hand.

- the Azimuth watcher GraphQL web server [is hosted here](https://azimuth.dev.vdb.to/graphql) and loaded with sample queries
- see the [Azimuth Watcher overview](https://github.com/LaconicNetwork/awesome-urbit/blob/main/docs/azimuth-watcher.md) for more information
- the [stack orchestrator Azimuth stack](./azimuth-stack/) is a good example of a watcher stack to review when creating one for yourself
