The Laconic stack provides robust indexing solutions to web3 developers. Using the stack also provides a greater degree of decentralization, otherwise unavailable from typical web3 workflows. This documentation consists of three core products:

1) stack orchestrator
2) watcher codegen
3) self hosting

which together, provide the foundation for hosting properly decentralized applications. This series walks you through a typical web3 workflow but using the Laconic stack.
