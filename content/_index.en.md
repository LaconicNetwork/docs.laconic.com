### Laconic Stack

The Laconic stack provides robust data indexing solutions for web3 Dapp developers. We make it easier and cheaper to get the data you need for your Dapp.

Using the stack also provides a greater degree of decentralization, otherwise unavailable from typical web3 workflows. This documentation consists of three core products:

1) stack orchestrator (`laconic-so`)
2) watcher codegen (`yarn codegen`)
3) self hosting (using Gitea)
4) e2e build verification (maybe?)

and walks you through a typical web3 workflow but using the Laconic stack. The "Stack Demos" section contains several what we call "stacks" for stack orchestrator. Some of these are combined to show the different components of Laconic working together. We built these tools for ourselves - they are dogfooded regularly.

The following diagram outlines the core codebase, as orchestrated by `laconic-so`:

### Laconic Network

The Laconic Network is planned to launch when the demand for verifiable data exceeds our current ability to supply it. The Laconic Stack is open source and much less expensive to run than full archive nodes but we still expect Dapp developers to outsource this cost.
