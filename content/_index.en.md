The Laconic stack provides robust indexing solutions to web3 developers. Using the stack also provides a greater degree of decentralization, otherwise unavailable from typical web3 workflows. This comes in two core products:

1) stack orchestrator
2) watcher codegen
3) self hosting

Although there are many components at play under the hood (e.g., statediffing), this documentation focuses on getting started with a simple Dapp using the Laconic stack.
