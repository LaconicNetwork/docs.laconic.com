Our current fork of geth with statediffing (one of the core offerings of the Laconic stack) is currently being integrated into the [plugeth framework](https://github.com/openrelayxyz/plugeth-utils/pull/31) for easier maintainability. This process is ongoing. Until it is complete, you can run the `mainnet-eth` stack via [these instructions](https://github.com/cerc-io/stack-orchestrator/blob/main/app/data/stacks/mainnet-eth/README.md) though note that it will eventually be depecrated in favour of the aforementioned plugeth integration.
