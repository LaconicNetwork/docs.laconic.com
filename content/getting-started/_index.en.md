Typically, one would follow along in this order:

1) install stack orchestrator - a multi purpose tool for handling Dapp testing and deployment
2) use stack orchestrator to deploy one or more existing stacks
3) install codegen - a GraphQL generator for smart contracts
4) select one or more smart contracts to watch
5) use codegen to generate a watcher for that contract - similar to "The Graph"
6) run our self-hosting tools (Gitea) in order
7) package and deliver your Dapp to users in a manner more decentralized than any other option
