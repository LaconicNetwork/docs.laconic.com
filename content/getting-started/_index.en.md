Typically, one would follow along in this order:

1) install stack orchestrator - a multi purpose tool for handling Dapp testing and deployment
2) use stack orchestrator to deploy one or more existing stacks
3) install codegen - a GraphQL generator for querying data from smart contracts
4) use codegen to generate a watcher for an example contract
5) explore how a more complex watcher is packaged for deployment
6) run our self-hosting tools (Gitea) which includes package registry utilities
7) package and deliver your Dapp to users in a manner more decentralized than any other option
